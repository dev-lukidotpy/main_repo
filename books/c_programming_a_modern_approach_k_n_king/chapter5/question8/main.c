    The following table shows the daily flights from one city to another:

    Departure time      Arrival time
     8:00 a.m.          10:16 a.m.
     9:43 a.m.          11:52 a.m.
     11:19 a.m.         1:31 p.m.
     12:47 p.m.         3:00 p.m.
     2:00 p.m.          4:08 p.m.
     3:45 p.m.          5:55 p.m.
     7:00 p.m.          9:20 p.m.
     9:45 p.m.          11:58 p.m.

    Write a program that asks user to enter a time (expressed in hours and minutes, using the 24-
    hour clock). The program then displays the departure and arrival times for the flight whose
    departure time is closest to that entered by the user:

    Enter a 24-hour time: 13:15
    Closest departure time is 12:47 p.m., arriving at 3:00 p.m.

    Hint: Convert the input into a time expressed in minutes since midnight, and compare it to
    the departure times, also expressed in minutes since midnight. For example, 13:15 is 13 Ã—
    60 + 15 = 795 minutes since midnight, which is closer to 12:47 p.m. (767 minutes since
    midnight) than to any of the other departure times.
