    Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates and displays their

    Enter two integers: 12 28
    Greatest common divisor: 4

    Hint: The classic algorithm for computing the GCD, known as Euclidâ€™s algorithm, goes as follows:
    Let m and n be variables containing the two numbers. If n is 0, then stop: m contains the GCD.
    Otherwise, compute the remainder when m is divided by n.
    Copy n into m and copy the remainder into n. Then repeat the process, starting with testing whether n is 0.
